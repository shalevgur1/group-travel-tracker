This web application allows you to track the travel destinations of your family or a group of friends.
Each member’s visited countries are displayed on an interactive map.

To get the application up and running, follow these steps:
1. Ensure PostgreSQL is installed on your computer.
2. Import the world-database-schema PostgreSQL schema file to create the necessary database structure.
3. Update the connection credentials at the top of the index.js file to match your local PostgreSQL server settings (user, host, database, password, port).
4. Run the application using Node.js by executing the command node index.js in the application’s directory.
